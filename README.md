peano
=====

This package contains a library defining natural numbers
in Peano representation and some operations on this representation.

It is intended as a simple example for functional logic programming
and using narrowing for solving constraints.

A more sophisticated representation of natural and integer numbers
with efficient operations can be found in the package `binint`.
